Fylm
=======================

Fylm is a wonderful automated command line app for organizing your film media. You can pronounce it Film or File 'em, whichever you like!

It uses (highly suspect) regular expressions to identify film files (or folders), then looks them up on https://www.themoviedb.org/ to get all the correct details. Once that's over and done with, it'll rename them according to your OCD standards, and move them.
