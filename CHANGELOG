# Change Log
# All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
# This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [0.4.0-beta] 2021-05-20
- Complete overhaul and rewrite with modern Python, based on pathlib and asyncio
- All lookups are done in parallel, when you launch Fylm, because TMDb no longer rate-limits its API requests
- Introduce FilmPath, a lowlevel subclass of Path to handle all Film and File operations
- Fast, recursive searching of all src paths; intelligently identifies where a film root is
- Duplicates are now handled on the fly, for each film, so new duplicates are caught in the same exec
- Mapping direcory scans to films runs asyncronously, in parallel
- Better naming of folders with multiple video files (e.g., 'Extras' is appended)
- Interactive search now remembers the previous search query
- Copying now safely moves duplicates to a temporary .dup~ file
- Expanded scope of tests for increased stability
- Improved console output
- Interactive mode now supports upgrading all duplicates
- Interactive mode now processes duplicates for each file in a src folder
- Upgrades now compare quality of media as well as file size

## [0.3.1-beta] 2021-03-27
- Intelligent suggestions (upgrades & duplicate handling) in interactive mode
- Quality-based upgrades (e.g., Bluray can upgrade WEBDL)
- Improved duplicate checking and stability for duplicate removal
- Support for HDR 4K files
- Multiple duplicates support
- Thanks to new intelligent upgrading, force override can better match its description
- Improvements to console output, including source dir
- Ability to hide skipped files in the console output now
- Minimum file size can now be different per-resolution
- Fylm is now published under Hippocratic License with additional fallback via GPLv3
- Additional tests and bug fixes
- Note: this will be the last release that supports Python 3.5, as it is nearing and of life. 
  Future versions will also take of asynchronous eventing, which isn't supported very well in 3.5.
- Breaking: Several config.yaml structural changes for duplicates, see config.yaml for an example. 
  Recommend backing up your config.yaml before upgrading

## [0.3.0-beta] 2019-11-05

## [0.2.4-alpha] 2018-02-28

- Migrate to requirements.txt
- Reduce TravisCI footprint and ensure 2.7 tests only run with ASCII chars

## [0.2.2-alpha] 2018-02-08
- A robust duplicate checking algorithm that allows user-configurable replace/keep settings
- Overhaul of test system to run via pytest to allow for additional tests to be written
